# User Stories

This folder contains the **user stories** for the Airbnb Clone backend project.  
User stories describe the features of the system from the perspective of its users, helping us understand the goals, needs, and interactions of each actor.

---

## Purpose

The goal of documenting user stories is to:

- Capture **functional requirements** in a simple, user-centered way.
- Provide a reference for **design, development, and testing**.
- Ensure that the platform addresses the needs of **guests, hosts, and administrators**.

---

## Structure

The user stories are grouped by actor:

- **Guest User Stories** â†’ cover registration, booking, payments, reviews, and notifications.  
- **Host User Stories** â†’ cover property management, payouts, and interactions with guests.  
- **Admin User Stories** â†’ cover system management of users, listings, bookings, and payments.  

Each file follows the format:

```text
As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit].
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

- Developers should use these stories as a **reference** when building backend endpoints and features.  
- Testers should create **test cases** to ensure each story is covered.  
- Contributors can **add new stories** as features evolve.
